h2. ch.elexis.core.data

Basic functionality for a data storage. The goal is not to make any assumptions on the type of storage here. It should be possible to use relational database engines as well as NoSQL storage systems or Webservices transparently.

To achieve this, any persistable object must implement IPersistentObject ore descendands of IPersistentObject. Business logic should only use the interfaces, not the implementations of the persistence classes.
