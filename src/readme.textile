h1. Howto build Elexis 

The special "Elexis repository":https://github.com/zdavatz/elexis is used as demo implementation (spike) for the conference "http://www.ywesee.com/pmwiki.php/Oddb/OpenSourceSoftwareUndDatenImSchweizerGesundheitswesen":http://www.ywesee.com/pmwiki.php/Oddb/OpenSourceSoftwareUndDatenImSchweizerGesundheitswesen

Based on "buildr4osgi":http://oss.intalio.com/buildr4osgi/ "Buildr for Apache":http://buildr.apache.org to build and test quickly "Elexis":http://www.elexis.ch

h2. features

Inherited via buildr

* whole build process managed by an easy to read @buildfile@
* compiles plugins
* runs junit4 tests
* runs cobertura or emma to get our code coverage
* generates a zip file for installation (@buildr install@)
* checks generates jar whether it contains the needed pieces
* easy upload of a generated version to a choosen location (@buildr upload@)
* almost ready for "automatic release":http://buildr.apache.org/releasing.html

Added via files in @lib/*.rb@ and @tasks/*.rake@

* read standard eclipse file (.project, build.properties, plugin.xml, MANIFEST.MF) to correctly configure buildr. Also 'magically' adds tests from a plugin like @ch.elexis_test@ to the source code plugin @ch.elexis@
* transform textile-files into PDFs via wikitext_to_xslo & fop
* transform *.tex files into pdf using texi2pdf 
* create an eclipse target platform based on a eclipse target definition
* create an eclipse product based on an eclipse product definition
* create an IzPack installer (work to be done to create a single installer for all supported platform)

The following things still need fixes (but worked more or less at some points)

* creating a P2 site (eclipse p2 ant task spills out some error messages)
* running PDE unit test (see @pde_test.causes_problem@)
* create a Debian package for Elexis

h2. bootstrapping buildr

Last time tested February, 10 on Debian Squeeze x86 using:

@sudo debootstrap squeeze /opt/squeeze-chroot http://172.25.1.60:9999/debian@ 
@sudo chroot  /opt/squeeze-chroot@
@sudo aptitude install ruby maven2 git sun-java6-jdk|openjdk-6-jdk@

h2. building Elexis

clone the repository (read-only)

@cd /opt@
@git clone git://github.com/zdavatz/elexis.git@
@cd elexis-buildr@

Now you are ready to build.

@export P2_EXE=/path/to/existing/eclipse/installation@
@ruby rebuild_all.rb@
